# B Corporations Analysis
We all deal with tons of businesses every day, like the ones we work at, or the ones we listen to on podcasts during breakfast. Or maybe the stores where we buy food (I might be a little obsessed with food, but maybe that's just 'cause I'm Italian!).

The thing is, we're all tied to businesses somehow, and what we decide to buy or do every day matters. Some businesses try to help the world, society, or the environment by making things better, but it's not always simple to know which ones to believe. That's because a lot of places try to look green without really doing anything.

One group that tries to get real, responsible businesses together is B Corp. I did some learning to try and get a better sense of what B Corporations are all about: who they are, where they are, and what they do. I began by looking around the world, then I focused on France, and then took a look at insights around Europe.

Of course, there are companies that are not B Corps that still leave the world better than they found it, but B Corp is a community I noticed, and I wanted to explore it further.

## Repository contents
B_Corps.ipynb — data analysis notebook with explorations around B Corps worldwide, in France, and in Europe.
Note: interactive visualizations require rendering JavaScript and HTML in a web browser environment. They display correctly when running the notebook locally (e.g., in Jupyter or VS Code), but GitHub does not render Plotly elements embedded in Jupyter notebooks.

B_Corporations.pdf — a more structured and organic report collecting the main findings.
In this PDF you will find the geographical maps that are not visible on GitHub.
To produce it, I experimented with various tools — Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Docs, Looker Studio, Tableau Public — with the goal of testing multiple data visualization and reporting environments as part of my professional retraining.

## Objectives of the project
- Explore and understand what B Corps are, where they are located, and which industries they operate in.
- Compare global distribution vs France and Europe, using both code-driven and no-code tools.
- Experiment with different visualization platforms and workflows to strengthen analytical and editorial skills.

## Tools and workflow
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly) for data cleaning and analysis.
- Google Sheets for quick transformations and pivoting.
- Tableau Public and Looker Studio for interactive dashboards.
- Google Slides / Google Docs for presentation and report building.
