We all deal with tons of businesses every day, like the ones we work at, or the ones we listen to on podcasts during breakfast. Or maybe the stores where we buy food (I might be a little obsessed with food, but maybe that's just 'cause I'm Italian!).

The thing is, we're all tied to businesses somehow, and what we decide to buy or do every day matters. Some businesses try to help the world, society, or the environment by making things better, it's not always simple to know which ones to believe. That's because a lot of places try to look green without really doing anything.

One group that tries to get real, responsible businesses together is B Corp. I did some learning to try and get a better sense of what B Corporations are all about: who they are, where they are, and what they do. I began by looking around the world, then I focused on France, and then took a look at insights around Europe. There are companies that are not B Corps that leave the world better than they found it, but B Corp is a group that I noticed, and I wanted to find out more.

Note on Choropleth Maps Display in B_Corps.ipynb: the choropleth maps created with Plotly in this notebook are interactive visualizations that require rendering JavaScript and HTML in a web browser environment. While these maps display correctly when running the notebook locally (e.g., in Jupyter or Visual Studio Code), GitHub does not render the interactive Plotly visualizations embedded in Jupyter notebooks.
